About Google Web Fonts

A web with web fonts is more beautiful, readable, accessible and open.

Google Web Fonts makes it quick and easy for everyone to use web fonts, including professional designers and developers. We believe that everyone should be able to bring quality typography to their web pages and applications.

Our goal is to create a directory of web fonts for the world to use. Our API service makes it easy to add Google Web Fonts to a website in seconds. The service runs on Google's servers which are fast, reliable and tested. Google provides this service free of charge.
Open Source Fonts

All of the fonts are Open Source. This means that you are free to share your favorites with friends and colleagues. You can even customize them for your own use, or collaborate with the original designer to improve them. And you can use them in every way you want, privately or commercially — in print, on your computer, or in your websites.

We are working with designers around the world to publish quality typeface designs that are made for the web. If you are a type designer and would like to discuss this, please get in touch.

Many of Google's own web pages are already using Google Web Fonts, such as Google's About page and Google's World Wonders Project which use Open Sans.
