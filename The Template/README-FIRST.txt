By default, both the HTML and PHP template versions use the wide layout version.

The only difference between the wide and boxed layout versions is the "style.css" file.

To transform the website from wide to boxed, overwrite the "style.css" file from the HTML or PHP folder with the "style.css" file located in the "boxed" folder.
